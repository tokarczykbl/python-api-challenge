# python-api-challenge
Repository for Module 6 Challenge for UNC Data Analytics
Included in my repo are two Jupyter Notebook files VacationPy and WeatherPy which have been run for January 28th, 2024.  It is pulling live weather data from Open Weather API.
In the output folder is a cities.csv file, and 4 images of plots created in my code.
